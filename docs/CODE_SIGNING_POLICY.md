# Code signing policy — wordcraft Craft edition (application pending)

**Status on 2026-10-19:** the public modified fork is a candidate for SignPath Foundation's *free open-source code signing*. **NO APPLICATION APPROVAL OR SIGNED CRAFT RELEASE IS CLAIMED.** The required public attribution, *“Free code signing provided by SignPath.io, certificate by SignPath Foundation”*, will apply only if the project is accepted and its actual releases are signed with that service.

## Project origin and legal gate

- Source repository: https://github.com/Yanakiev432/wordcraft; public GitHub fork (GitHub API `fork=true`) of https://github.com/storytold/wordcraft.
- GitHub-reported license: Apache-2.0. Original upstream, third-party copyright/NOTICE files and source obligations must be retained and rechecked before redistribution.
- Official upstream release: `v0.8.0`, Windows x64 MSI, **81330176 bytes**, SHA-256 `7ca27a11f7122322a2525af4e11308abb70b1cdb2625b5ab95afadcac12d79bb`.
- On 2026-10-19 Windows Get-AuthenticodeSignature returned **Valid**, signer **Learning Machines Inc** for that exact upstream MSI. No executable was launched or installed.
- This demonstrates an officially signed upstream release and visible fork relationship, two of SignPath Foundation's modified-fork eligibility conditions. **It is not a guarantee of eligibility or approval**; the remaining terms require verification by SignPath.

## Roles and release approval

- Source-code custodian and maintainer: https://github.com/Yanakiev432.
- Committers: repository maintainers with explicitly assigned GitHub write rights. External contributions require human review before acceptance.
- Release approver: repository maintainer; approve every signing request explicitly within SignPath, using MFA.
- Qualified separate reviewer for release-signing policies: **TO BE VERIFIED / ASSIGNED BEFORE APPLICATION**. Never fabricate a review or signing approval.
- Source and CI build scripts are reviewed together. Protect the release branch, pin build inputs and use trusted, origin-verified GitHub Actions builds from the exact release tag. No self-hosted unsigned binaries may enter the production signing lane.

## Signable outputs and verification

- Sign **only this project's own built EXE, DLL and MSI** (as applicable), never re-sign upstream packages as if they were our own.
- Product metadata, name, version, and original source commit must match the approved release.
- The signing identity stays with the approved hosted code-signing provider. Do not use a B-Trust *document-QES* certificate as an EXE/MSI Code Signing EKU credential, export USB PINs, or disable SAC/WDAC.
- Verify every published artifact with full SHA-256, Authenticode Code Signing EKU, timestamp and a real clean Windows SAC-enforced install/uninstall/rollback smoke test.
- Until all gates pass, release status is **NO-GO**, including any unsigned MSI candidates.

## Privacy and security

- The signing implementation processes users' local documents; hardware PIN entry remains with the legitimate certificate provider UI.
- A user-approved RFC 3161 TSA integration sends a cryptographic imprint and nonce, **not the original document**. The user chooses the provider; ACCV free use is limited to permitted personal usage. Open TSA is not eIDAS qualified.
- Additional optional network-dependent application features and upstream dependencies require separate privacy disclosure. Do not assert that the entire application never uses the network without code review.
- Avoid storing user documents, private keys, TSA credentials, or hardware PINs in source, CI artifacts, or public logs.

## Required release provenance before requesting free signing

1. Source/code/license/dependency audit and documented upstream signed-release evidence.
2. Public README link to this policy, review/approval roles, accessible release/download information and existing releases of the modified project.
3. MFA, protected release branches, reviewable source CI and build provenance with artifact naming/version enforcement.
4. Manual SignPath Foundation application and **written approval**, including any project-specific fork conditions.
5. Hosted trusted build/signing pipeline, manual release approval, independent Authenticode and SAC tests. Never mark this step PASS on the strength of an upstream signature.

## Verified publisher binding for Windows trusted-release acceptance

`packaging/windows/assert-trusted-release.ps1` now **fails closed** unless a
64-character SHA-256 fingerprint of the *preapproved* software-publisher X.509
certificate is supplied in `CRAFT_RELEASE_PUBLISHER_SHA256` (or as
`-ExpectedPublisherSha256`). It checks the complete DER certificate digest,
a valid Authenticode signature, Code Signing EKU, timestamp certificate and the
current conservative RSA publisher policy.

The expected fingerprint **must come from an independently authorized signing
identity**, e.g. the approved SignPath Foundation publisher profile and human
release review. Do not compute the expected fingerprint from the untrusted
MSI/EXE being evaluated and immediately reuse it as an allowlist value; that
would defeat publisher binding. Do not accept Learning Machines Inc's upstream
signed packages as proof that the modified Craft edition is signed by its own
authorized issuer.

On the approved release host, after independently approving the issuer identity
and trusted hosted signing setup, use PowerShell 7:

```powershell
$env:CRAFT_RELEASE_PUBLISHER_SHA256 = '<64-HEX-OF-PREAPPROVED-SOFTWARE-PUBLISHER-CERTIFICATE>'
pwsh -NoProfile -File packaging/windows/package.ps1 -Arch x64 -RequireTrustedRelease
```

This example does not supply certificate material, grant credentials, or sign a
binary by itself. Missing/incorrect publisher fingerprint, absent signature,
incomplete timestamp or untrusted certificate cause `CODE_SIGNING_NO_GO`.
The optional `-RequireTrustedRelease` keeps ordinary development builds
separate; any actual public release must additionally enforce this acceptance
in its release workflow and pass a clean-device Windows SAC install/uninstall
review. Approval, signing and a production publisher fingerprint are
**NOT YET AVAILABLE**. Never disable SAC, WDAC, revocation checks or Windows
certificate-trust controls to force a PASS.
